# Frequently asked questions

## Is it a fork of the Mod Organizer?
Not in any way, it's completely independent project. Kortex does share the general idea with Mod Organizer and has some overlapping features but that doesn't make it a rip-off.

## What about Vortex, the new NexusMods mod manager?
Indeed Kortex is named after Vortex but it wasn't my idea. I needed a name starting at "K" because of the program long history. I was about to release v1.0 and then Vortex as been announced. I had no good variants for a name so I asked some people and one of them suggested "Kortex". Because of lack of better options I've chosen that name.

Once again, I started Kortex development in July 2017, about the same time as Vortex I think. And before that I've had two generations of mod managers (**KMM Gen.: 0** and **KMM Gen.: 1** as I call them). Their development started at December 2011 and February 2016 respectively.

## What are the differences between Kortex and other mod managers?
Please look at the [comparison table](?page=comparison).

## I've heard that Kortex VFS is slow. Is that true?
No, it's not true. Well, actually it depends. In comparison to pure NTFS (no VFS) it's slow. In comparison to other virtual file systems implementations not so much. That said MO1 and MO2 VFS is faster than KxVFS and Vortex not-so-much-VFS is faster than MO. KxVFS in Kortex v2.x is faster than in v1.x. I don't really feel any discomfort when playing.

## Does Kortex only support Bethesda games?
Yes at the moment. Other games can be added in the future. In theory Kortex should be able to support almost any game but there is no simple way to add completely new game. There is **Sacred 2** as an example of non-Bethesda game.

You can try to add a new game by creating game definition file in **Data\GameDefinitions** folder. I do not provide any support in that case.
